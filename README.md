# Who am I?

My name is Ryan Oh, and I'm currently a 3rd year Bachelor of Computer Science Major at the University of British Columbia.
I'm currently working in game development, but also branching out into other realms, such as UI/UX design, machine learning and all types of software development. (I really want to do front-end, so hire me)

You can check out my linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhiknow/) and my github [here](https://github.com/rhiknow55/)

Now without further ado, let's check out the projects!


## Industry Projects

These are some of the projects I've worked on during Co-ops, UBC Worklearns, and at startups!
