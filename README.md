# Who am I?

I'm currently a 3rd year Bachelor of Computer Science Major at the University of British Columbia.
I'm currently working in game development, but also branching out into other realms, such as UI/UX design, machine learning and all types of software development (I really want to do front-end, so hire me)

You can check out my linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhiknow/) and my github [here](https://github.com/rhiknow55/)

Now without further ado, let's check out the projects!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rhiknow55/rhiknow55.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
