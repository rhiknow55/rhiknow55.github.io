# Who am I?

My name is Ryan Oh, and I'm currently a 4th year Bachelor of Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia.
So far I've worked in VR and mobile game development in the industry. But I'm also branching out into other realms, such as UI/UX design, machine learning and all types of software development via personal projects and curriculum in school.
