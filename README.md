# Who am I?

My name is Ryan Oh, and I'm currently a 3rd year Bachelor of Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia.
So far I've worked in VR and mobile game development in the industry. But I'm also branching out into other realms, such as UI/UX design, machine learning and all types of software development via curriculum in school and personal projects.

You can check out my linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhiknow/) and my github [here](https://github.com/rhiknow55/)

Now without further ado, let's check out the projects!


## Industry Projects

These are some of the projects I've worked on during Co-ops, UBC Worklearns, and at startups!
